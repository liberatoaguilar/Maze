  - If a cell has 1-4 neighbors it survives and if it has exactly 3 neighbors it is born. If it has more 4 or less than 1 neighbor it dies.
- B3/S12345 rulestring
  - If a cell has 1-5 neighbors it survives and if it has exactly 3 neighbors it is born. If it has more 5 or less than 1 neighbor it dies.
